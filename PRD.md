Product Requirements Document (PRD)
1. Overview and Purpose
Objective:
Build a web app that verifies whether new users can successfully schedule a demo meeting via a company’s landing page. The tool will automatically test the “Book a Demo” flow and present results in an easy-to-understand dashboard.

Target Users:

Marketing and Sales teams looking to ensure their demo booking flows are working

QA Engineers validating conversion funnels

Product teams monitoring and improving user onboarding

2. Objectives & Goals
Speed: Quickly execute tests using a modern, high-performance automation framework.

Accuracy: Reliably simulate user behavior, from landing page entry to booking confirmation.

Usability: Provide a clear interface for entering URLs, triggering tests, and reviewing results.

Scalability: Allow multiple tests to be run concurrently, with clear error reporting and insights.

3. User Stories
As a Marketing Manager, I want to input my landing page URL and instantly see if the “Book a Demo” flow is working, so I can ensure a smooth user experience.

As a QA Engineer, I want detailed insights on each step of the booking process, so I can quickly identify and fix issues.

As a Developer, I want an extensible system where new test scenarios can be added, so the tool evolves alongside our landing pages.

4. Functional Requirements
Frontend (Next.js)
URL Input Form:

A text field for entering the landing page URL.

A “Run Test” button to trigger the testing process.

Results Dashboard:

Display whether the demo booking flow was detected.

Show booking process results (success/failure).

List any errors or issues encountered during the test.

Provide screenshots or performance metrics from key steps.

Backend (Next.js API Routes / Node.js)
API Endpoint:

Accepts a POST request with the landing page URL.

Triggers the Playwright automation script.

Returns a structured JSON response with:

demo_flow_found: Boolean indicating if the “Book a Demo” element was detected.

booking_successful: Boolean indicating if the booking flow completed.

errors: An array of error messages, if any.

Important insights (timing data, screenshots paths, etc.).

Automated Testing Flow (Using Playwright)
Page Navigation:

Open the landing page URL in a headless browser.

Element Detection:

Search for “Book a Demo” (or similar) buttons/links using robust selectors (e.g., XPath, CSS).

User Simulation:

Click the demo booking button.

Wait for the booking page to load.

Fill in required fields (name, email, etc.) using test data.

Submit the booking form.

Verification:

Validate the presence of a confirmation page or a “Thank You” message.

Record steps, timings, and potential issues.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance:

Automated tests should run within a reasonable timeframe (ideally under 30 seconds per run).

Reliability:

Utilize Playwright’s auto-waiting features to reduce flaky tests.

Implement error handling to catch and log unexpected behaviors.

Scalability:

Design the backend to handle multiple concurrent tests, possibly using asynchronous API processing.

Security:

Validate user inputs (e.g., proper URL formatting) to prevent misuse.

Ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.

6. Technical Architecture
Technology Stack
Frontend:

Next.js: For building a modern, responsive UI.

React Components: To manage form input and results display.

Backend:

Next.js API Routes / Node.js:

Use Next.js API routes for simplicity and ease of integration with the frontend.

Playwright:

For headless browser automation to simulate the demo booking flow.

High-Level System Flow
User Interaction:

User enters a URL and clicks “Run Test” on the Next.js frontend.

API Call:

The frontend sends a POST request to a Next.js API route.

Automated Testing:

The API route triggers a Playwright script that:

Navigates to the URL.

Detects the “Book a Demo” button.

Follows the booking flow.

Returns the test result.

Results Display:

The frontend receives and renders the results in a user-friendly format.

7. Implementation Plan
Step 1: Frontend Development (Next.js)
Design the UI:

Create a clean landing page with an input field and button.

Develop a results panel to display test outcomes.

Integrate API Calls:

Use Next.js API routes to trigger backend testing.

Handle loading states and error messages.

Step 2: Backend/API Development
Create API Endpoint:

Implement a Next.js API route (e.g., /api/test-demo-flow) that accepts POST requests with the landing page URL.

Integrate Playwright:

Write a Playwright script that:

Opens the landing page.

Searches for the “Book a Demo” button.

Simulates clicks and form submissions.

Captures results and any error messages.

Ensure robust error handling and timeout settings.

Step 3: Testing & Validation
Local Testing:

Run local tests to simulate various landing page scenarios.

Adjust selectors and waits based on observed behaviors.

User Testing:

Gather feedback from potential users to refine UI/UX and error reporting.

Step 4: Deployment & Monitoring
Deployment:

Deploy the Next.js app (e.g., on Vercel or a Node.js hosting provider).

Monitoring:

Implement logging for API errors and test metrics.

Optionally store test results in a lightweight database for historical analysis.

8. Timeline & Milestones
Week 1:

Define detailed requirements and design UI wireframes.

Set up Next.js project structure.

Week 2:

Develop the frontend form and results panel.

Implement the API endpoint and integrate Playwright script.

Week 3:

Conduct local testing and refine Playwright selectors and error handling.

Incorporate user feedback and perform bug fixes.

Week 4:

Deploy the application.

Monitor initial usage and iterate based on further insights.

9. Risks and Mitigations
Dynamic Web Content:

Risk: Variations in landing page designs may lead to inconsistent element detection.

Mitigation: Use configurable selectors and robust waiting strategies provided by Playwright.

Flaky Tests:

Risk: Network delays or asynchronous content loading might cause test flakiness.

Mitigation: Leverage Playwright’s auto-waiting features and implement explicit timeouts.

Scalability Challenges:

Risk: High test volumes could strain the API.

Mitigation: Consider asynchronous job processing or rate-limiting if necessary.

10. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for building the Landing Page Lead Funnel Validation Tool. By leveraging Next.js for both frontend and API routes and integrating Playwright for reliable, fast browser automation, the solution aims to deliver accurate insights into the demo booking flow. This design not only meets the assessment requirements but also establishes a scalable foundation for future enhancements.
