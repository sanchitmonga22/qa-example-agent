# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

### Objective
Build a web app that verifies whether new users can successfully schedule a demo meeting via a company's landing page. The tool will automatically test the "Book a Demo" flow and present results in an easy-to-understand dashboard.

### Target Users
- Marketing and Sales teams looking to ensure their demo booking flows are working
- QA Engineers validating conversion funnels
- Product teams monitoring and improving user onboarding

## 2. Objectives & Goals
- **Speed**: Quickly execute tests using a modern, high-performance automation framework.
- **Accuracy**: Reliably simulate user behavior, from landing page entry to booking confirmation.
- **Usability**: Provide a clear interface for entering URLs, triggering tests, and reviewing results.
- **Scalability**: Allow multiple tests to be run concurrently, with clear error reporting and insights.
- **Reliability**: Ensure the testing infrastructure is robust and can handle the resource requirements of browser automation.

## 3. User Stories
- As a **Marketing Manager**, I want to input my landing page URL and instantly see if the "Book a Demo" flow is working, so I can ensure a smooth user experience.
- As a **QA Engineer**, I want detailed insights on each step of the booking process, so I can quickly identify and fix issues.
- As a **Developer**, I want an extensible system where new test scenarios can be added, so the tool evolves alongside our landing pages.
- As an **Operations Manager**, I want the testing tool to be reliably hosted with minimal maintenance requirements, so I can focus on analyzing results rather than infrastructure.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Frontend (Next.js)

#### URL Input Form
- A text field for entering the landing page URL.
- A "Run Test" button to trigger the testing process.

#### Results Dashboard
- Display whether the demo booking flow was detected.
- Show booking process results (success/failure).
- List any errors or issues encountered during the test.
- Provide screenshots or performance metrics from key steps.

### Backend (Next.js API Routes / Node.js)

#### API Endpoint
- Accepts a POST request with the landing page URL.
- Triggers the Playwright automation script.
- Returns a structured JSON response with:
  - `demo_flow_found`: Boolean indicating if the "Book a Demo" element was detected.
  - `booking_successful`: Boolean indicating if the booking flow completed.
  - `errors`: An array of error messages, if any.
  - Important insights (timing data, screenshots paths, etc.).

### Automated Testing Flow (Using Playwright)

#### Page Navigation
- Open the landing page URL in a headless browser.

#### Element Detection
- Search for "Book a Demo" (or similar) buttons/links using robust selectors (e.g., XPath, CSS).

#### User Simulation
- Click the demo booking button.
- Wait for the booking page to load.
- Fill in required fields (name, email, etc.) using test data.
- Submit the booking form.

#### Verification
- Validate the presence of a confirmation page or a "Thank You" message.
- Record steps, timings, and potential issues.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Automated tests should run within a reasonable timeframe (ideally under 30 seconds per run).

### Reliability
- Utilize Playwright's auto-waiting features to reduce flaky tests.
- Implement error handling to catch and log unexpected behaviors.

### Scalability
- Design the backend to handle multiple concurrent tests, possibly using asynchronous API processing.

### Security
- Validate user inputs (e.g., proper URL formatting) to prevent misuse.
- Ensure secure communication between the frontend and backend.

### Hosting
- Deploy the Next.js frontend and API routes on Vercel for optimal performance and integration.
- Deploy the Playwright testing service on Railway.app to ensure reliable browser automation with sufficient resources.
- Implement secure communication between the two services.
- Provide monitoring and alerting for both hosting platforms.
- Ensure cost-effectiveness with estimated production costs of $30-40/month.

## 6. Technical Architecture

### Technology Stack

#### Frontend
- **Next.js**: For building a modern, responsive UI.
- **React Components**: To manage form input and results display.

#### Backend
- **Next.js API Routes**: For handling initial test requests and proxying to the testing service.
- **Railway.app**: For hosting the Playwright testing service with sufficient resources.

#### Playwright
- For headless browser automation to simulate the demo booking flow.

### High-Level System Flow

1. **User Interaction**:
   - User enters a URL and clicks "Run Test" on the Next.js frontend.

2. **API Call**:
   - The frontend sends a POST request to a Next.js API route.

3. **Proxy to Testing Service**:
   - The API route forwards the request to the Railway-hosted Playwright service.

4. **Automated Testing**:
   - The Playwright service:
     - Navigates to the URL.
     - Detects the "Book a Demo" button.
     - Follows the booking flow.
     - Returns the test result.

5. **Results Display**:
   - The frontend receives and renders the results in a user-friendly format.

## 7. Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Frontend Development (Next.js)
1. **Design the UI**:
   - Create a clean landing page with an input field and button.
   - Develop a results panel to display test outcomes.

2. **Integrate API Calls**:
   - Use Next.js API routes to trigger backend testing.
   - Handle loading states and error messages.

### Step 2: Backend/API Development
1. **Create API Endpoint**:
   - Implement a Next.js API route (e.g., `/api/test-booking-flow`) that accepts POST requests with the landing page URL.

2. **Create Proxy Logic**:
   - Implement forwarding logic to the Playwright testing service.

### Step 3: Playwright Testing Service
1. **Develop Testing Service**:
   - Create a standalone Node.js application with Playwright.
   - Implement the test automation logic.
   - Configure Docker deployment for Railway.app.

### Step 4: Testing & Validation
1. **Local Testing**:
   - Run local tests to simulate various landing page scenarios.
   - Adjust selectors and waits based on observed behaviors.

2. **User Testing**:
   - Gather feedback from potential users to refine UI/UX and error reporting.

### Step 5: Deployment & Monitoring
1. **Deployment**:
   - Deploy the Next.js app on Vercel.
   - Deploy the Playwright testing service on Railway.app.
   - Configure secure communication between services.

2. **Monitoring**:
   - Implement logging for API errors and test metrics.
   - Set up alerts for resource constraints or failures.

## 8. Timeline & Milestones

### Week 1
- Define detailed requirements and design UI wireframes.
- Set up Next.js project structure.

### Week 2
- Develop the frontend form and results panel.
- Implement the Next.js API endpoint and proxy logic.
- Start developing the Playwright testing service.

### Week 3
- Complete the Playwright testing service.
- Set up deployment pipelines for both Vercel and Railway.
- Conduct local testing and refine Playwright selectors and error handling.

### Week 4
- Conduct user acceptance testing.
- Deploy both services to production.
- Implement monitoring and alerting.
- Finalize documentation.

## 9. Risks and Mitigations

### Dynamic Web Content
- **Risk**: Variations in landing page designs may lead to inconsistent element detection.
- **Mitigation**: Use configurable selectors and robust waiting strategies provided by Playwright.

### Flaky Tests
- **Risk**: Network delays or asynchronous content loading might cause test flakiness.
- **Mitigation**: Leverage Playwright's auto-waiting features and implement explicit timeouts.

### Scalability Challenges
- **Risk**: High test volumes could strain the API and testing service.
- **Mitigation**: Implement request queuing and consider auto-scaling options in Railway.app.

### Hosting Reliability
- **Risk**: Browser automation requires significant resources that may exceed serverless function limits.
- **Mitigation**: Use the hybrid hosting approach with Railway.app for the resource-intensive Playwright service.

### Cost Management
- **Risk**: Usage-based pricing could lead to unexpected costs.
- **Mitigation**: Implement usage monitoring and alerts for abnormal patterns.

## 10. Conclusion
This PRD provides a comprehensive roadmap for building and hosting the Landing Page Lead Funnel Validation Tool. By leveraging Next.js on Vercel for the frontend and API routes, combined with a dedicated Playwright testing service on Railway.app, the solution offers a reliable, scalable, and cost-effective approach to automating booking flow validation. This hybrid hosting architecture ensures that the resource-intensive browser automation can run reliably while keeping the frontend performant and user-friendly.
