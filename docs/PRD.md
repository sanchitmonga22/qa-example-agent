# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. Overview and Purpose

### Objective
Build a web app that verifies whether new users can successfully schedule a demo meeting via a company's landing page. The tool will automatically test the "Book a Demo" flow and present results in an easy-to-understand dashboard. The system leverages AI-powered testing to adapt to various landing page designs and provide intelligent navigation decisions.

### Target Users
- Marketing and Sales teams looking to ensure their demo booking flows are working
- QA Engineers validating conversion funnels
- Product teams monitoring and improving user onboarding
- UX Designers seeking insights on booking flow usability

## 2. Objectives & Goals
- **Speed**: Quickly execute tests using a modern, high-performance automation framework.
- **Accuracy**: Reliably simulate user behavior, from landing page entry to booking confirmation.
- **Usability**: Provide a clear interface for entering URLs, triggering tests, and reviewing results.
- **Scalability**: Allow multiple tests to be run concurrently, with clear error reporting and insights.
- **Reliability**: Ensure the testing infrastructure is robust and can handle the resource requirements of browser automation.
- **Adaptability**: Use AI to intelligently navigate through diverse landing page structures and booking flows.
- **Flexibility**: Allow users to define custom test steps in natural language for specialized testing scenarios.

## 3. User Stories
- As a **Marketing Manager**, I want to input my landing page URL and instantly see if the "Book a Demo" flow is working, so I can ensure a smooth user experience.
- As a **QA Engineer**, I want detailed insights on each step of the booking process, so I can quickly identify and fix issues.
- As a **Developer**, I want an extensible system where new test scenarios can be added, so the tool evolves alongside our landing pages.
- As an **Operations Manager**, I want the testing tool to be reliably hosted with minimal maintenance requirements, so I can focus on analyzing results rather than infrastructure.
- As a **UX Designer**, I want to define custom test steps in natural language, so I can validate specific user paths through the booking flow.
- As a **Product Manager**, I want to understand the AI's decision-making process during navigation, so I can better interpret test results and improve our landing pages.

## 4. Functional Requirements

### Frontend (Next.js)

#### URL Input Form
- A text field for entering the landing page URL.
- An expandable section to add custom test steps in natural language.
- UI controls to add, edit, or remove test steps.
- A "Run Test" button to trigger the testing process.

#### Results Dashboard
- Show booking process results (success/failure).
- List any errors or issues encountered during the test.
- Provide screenshots or performance metrics from key steps.
- Show AI decision-making process for each test step.
- Display user-defined custom steps and their execution results.

### Backend (Next.js API Routes / Node.js)

#### API Endpoint
- Accepts a POST request with the landing page URL and optional custom test steps.
- Triggers the Playwright automation script with LLM guidance.
- Returns a structured JSON response with:
  - `custom_steps_results`: Array of results for each custom step.
  - `llm_decisions`: Array of LLM decisions made during the test.
  - `errors`: An array of error messages, if any.
  - Important insights (timing data, screenshots paths, etc.).

### Automated Testing Flow (Using Playwright and LLM)

#### Page Navigation
- Open the landing page URL in a headless browser.

#### LLM-Guided Element Detection
- Capture screenshot and DOM structure of the page.
- Send this information to the LLM with appropriate context and instructions.
- LLM analyzes the page and identifies the most likely "Book a Demo" element.

#### User Simulation with LLM Guidance
- LLM suggests which element to click for each step.
- System clicks the suggested element and waits for page changes.
- For form filling, LLM identifies form fields and suggests appropriate test data.
- LLM guides the form submission process.

#### Custom Test Step Execution
- Parse natural language test steps provided by the user.
- For each step, gather page context and present it to the LLM.
- LLM determines the appropriate action to fulfill the step.
- Execute the action and capture results.
- Continue to the next step until all steps are complete.

#### Verification
- LLM analyzes the final page to determine if a confirmation/thank you message is present.
- Record steps, timings, potential issues, and LLM decision-making process.
- Generate comprehensive report including custom steps and their outcomes.

## 5. Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance
- Automated tests should run within a reasonable timeframe (ideally under 60 seconds per run).
- LLM API calls should be optimized to minimize latency and cost.

### Reliability
- Utilize Playwright's auto-waiting features to reduce flaky tests.
- Implement error handling to catch and log unexpected behaviors.
- Create fallback strategies when LLM suggestions fail.

### Scalability
- Design the backend to handle multiple concurrent tests, possibly using asynchronous API processing.
- Implement efficient queuing for LLM API calls to handle rate limits.

### Security
- Validate user inputs (e.g., proper URL formatting) to prevent misuse.
- Ensure secure communication between the frontend, backend, and LLM service.
- Implement proper authentication for LLM API access.

### Hosting
- Deploy the Next.js frontend and API routes on Vercel for optimal performance and integration.
- Deploy the Playwright testing service on Railway.app to ensure reliable browser automation with sufficient resources.
- Implement secure communication between the services.
- Provide monitoring and alerting for both hosting platforms.
- Ensure cost-effectiveness with estimated production costs of $50-70/month (including LLM API costs).

4. **LLM-Guided Automated Testing**:
   - The Playwright service:
     - Navigates to the URL.
     - For each step (default or custom):
       - Captures screenshot and DOM structure.
       - Sends to LLM with appropriate context.
       - Receives action recommendation.
       - Executes the recommended action.
       - Verifies the outcome.
     - Returns the comprehensive test result.

5. **Results Display**:
   - The frontend receives and renders the results in a user-friendly format.
